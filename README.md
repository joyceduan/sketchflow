# TO-DO

## Welcome to SketchFlow!
### Joyce Duan and Austin Mills

The goal of this project is to create an interactive sketch management system (SMS) that allows users to collaborate, branch, and merge drawings. A user will be able to sketch and save the drawing at any point in timeâ€“they can then choose to revert back to a previous frame or choose to branch off a particular sketch. We want to streamline the design process into a structured management system akin to GitHub with code management. In this way, artists will be able to view and navigate through a comprehensive history of their sketch and therefore retrace their thought processes.

## Set Up
